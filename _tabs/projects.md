A showcase of my hands-on cybersecurity experience, spanning vulnerability assessments, practical penetration testing, and secure software development.

---

### 1. Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing
**Description:** Conducted a full vulnerability assessment on a deliberately vulnerable lab environment using industry-standard tools like Nmap, OpenVAS, and Metasploit to identify, exploit, and report potential security weaknesses.
* **Skills Highlighted:** Network scanning, vulnerability assessment, exploit testing, report writing.
* **Outcome/Deliverable:** Produced a detailed security report highlighting discovered vulnerabilities, risk levels, and recommended mitigations for the target infrastructure.

### 2. Capture The Flag (CTF) Challenges & Writeups
**Description:** Actively participate in advanced cybersecurity CTF challenges on platforms like Hack The Box and TryHackMe to solve real-world security problems, including finding hidden flags, cracking encoded messages, and exploiting weak configurations.
* **Skills Highlighted:** Problem-solving, Linux command-line proficiency, scripting, cryptography, reverse engineering, web security.
* **Outcome/Deliverable:** Authored step-by-step write-ups demonstrating the methodology for each challenge, including the enumeration process, tools utilized, and the final privilege escalation vectors.

### 3. Secure Web Application Development & Testing
**Description:** Developed a demonstration web application portal and performed rigorous security testing against it to identify and patch OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, specifically focusing on SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.
* **Skills Highlighted:** Web application security, OWASP top 10 awareness, input validation, penetration testing, ethical hacking.
* **Outcome/Deliverable:** Demonstrated effective fixes for discovered vulnerabilities, implemented secure coding practices, and delivered a mini security audit report detailing the before-and-after state of the application.
